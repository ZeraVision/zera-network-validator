# ZERA Open Use and Revenue Sharing License (ZERA License v1.0)

This license governs the use, modification, and redistribution of software under the ZERA License. The intent of this license is to encourage developers to use, modify, and innovate with the software freely, especially for small and medium-sized projects. The license allows nearly all use cases to be free of charge, while also ensuring that large, successful projects that wish to modify or utilize code outside of the ZERA Network contribute back to the ecosystem to protect the ZERA Network's interests.

By using, modifying, or distributing software licensed under the ZERA License, you agree to the following terms.

## 1. Use and Modification Rights

You are granted permission to use, modify, and distribute this software, provided that any modifications or derivative works are made publicly available under this same ZERA License.

Any changes or improvements to the software must be published in an open and accessible repository within 90 days of the modification.

**Prohibited Use**: The software may not be used, modified, or distributed in any manner that undermines or otherwise harms ZERA, the ZERA Network, its core infrastructure, governance, or fundamental principles. Any such use will be considered a breach of this license.

## 2. Revenue Sharing and Compliance

The following progressive revenue-sharing model applies to any revenue derived directly or indirectly from the use, modification, or distribution of this software, based on annual revenues:

- $0 - $5,000,000 USD: No revenue-sharing obligations.
- $5,000,001 - $10,000,000 USD: 1% of revenue within this range must be transferred to the ZERA Treasury Address in an accepted instrument, defined by the ZERA "Authorized Currency Equivalent" ($ACE) list.
- $10,000,001 - $50,000,000 USD: An additional 1% per $10,000,000 USD of revenue is due for every $10,000,000 increment in this range, starting at 10% for revenues over $10,000,001 USD, capping at 15% for revenues of $50,000,000 USD or more.

**Revenue Cap**: The revenue-sharing requirement shall not exceed 15% of the total revenue, regardless of how much revenue is generated beyond $50,000,000 USD.

All revenue transactions tied to the use of this software that meet or exceed the applicable thresholds must be documented, and the records must be made publicly accessible through a transparent medium (e.g., a public blockchain ledger, repository, or recognized platform). All records must be updated within 90 days of the transaction and be accessible for audit.

**Exclusion Clause**: This revenue-sharing agreement does not apply to any services built on top of or integrated with the ZERA Network itself. For the avoidance of doubt, a "service built on top of" refers to applications, platforms, or tools that interface with the ZERA Network but do not modify or redistribute the licensed software directly. Modifications to the core ZERA software are still subject to this license.

## 3. Breach and Legal Enforcement

In the event of a breach of these licensing terms, any holder of ZERA ($ZRA+0000) has the right to initiate legal proceedings against the user in breach. However, to minimize frivolous lawsuits and ensure actions are taken in good faith, the following conditions must be met:

Before initiating legal proceedings, the group of ZERA holders must make a reasonable and good-faith effort to resolve the breach through mediation or arbitration with the user in breach. Legal action should only be pursued if remediation efforts fail.

Any official legal action must be supported by an approved governance proposal in the $LEGAL+0000 contract.

Any settlement or winnings from such legal proceedings will be distributed as follows:
- 50% to the ZERA holder(s) who execute any legal actions, settlements, bear costs, etc.
- 50% to the ZERA Treasury.

Upon resolution of the breach, the violating party must come into full compliance with these licensing terms, including any retroactive payments or required actions, and submit proof of compliance publicly.

## 4. Transparency and Reporting

Any entity using, modifying, or deriving revenue from this software must publicly disclose their usage, revenues derived, and compliance actions (such as payments to the ZERA Treasury) on a quarterly basis. Reports must be made accessible through a public medium (such as a blockchain ledger, public repository, or official reporting portal).

Failure to provide transparency and reporting within the defined quarterly period will be considered a breach of this license. A breach of reporting obligations may be escalated to the ZERA holder enforcement mechanism as outlined in Section 3.

The ZERA Treasury or an appointed auditing body has the right to verify any claims of revenue and compliance.

## 5. No Warranty and Limitation of Liability

This software is provided "as-is" without any warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

In no event shall the authors or contributors of the software be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.
