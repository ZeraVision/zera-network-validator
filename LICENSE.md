### ZERA Open Use and Revenue Sharing License (ZERA License v1.1)

**Preamble:**  
This license governs the use, modification, and redistribution of software under the ZERA License. The intent of this license is to encourage developers to use, modify, and innovate with the software without up-front costs.

By using, modifying, or distributing software licensed under the ZERA License, you agree to the following terms.

---

### 1. Use and Modification Rights

- You are granted permission to use, modify, and distribute this software, provided that any modifications or derivative works are made publicly available under this same ZERA License.
    
- Any changes or improvements to the software must be published in an open and accessible repository within 90 days of the modification.
    
- **Prohibited Use**: The software may not be used, modified, or distributed in any manner that undermines or harms ZERA, the ZERA Network, its core infrastructure, governance, or foundational principles. Any such use will be considered a breach of this license.

### 2. Revenue Sharing and Compliance

- The following revenue-sharing model applies to **any gross revenue generated from fees collected directly or indirectly as a result of executing ZERA Network code or its fee-generating derivatives**, or through any fork, derivative, or implementation that replicates or extends the ZERA Network's core fee-generating logic:
    
    - **If annual network revenue is below 5,000 USD**: No revenue-sharing obligations apply.
        
    - **If annual network revenue is 5,000 USD or more**: A flat **25 percent** of all gross revenue collected from the network must be paid to the **ZERA Treasury Address** in a recognized currency or token listed under the Authorized Currency Equivalent (**$ACE**) schedule.
        
- **Gross network revenue** refers to all protocol-level fees or value captured directly through the use of the software, including but not limited to:
    
    - Transaction fees
        
    - Execution or gas fees
        
    - Validator or sequencer payments
        
    - Protocol service charges
        
    - Automation or settlement fees
        
    - Any on-chain value accrual mechanisms executed by ZERA Network code or its derivatives
        
- Revenue must be calculated on a gross basis, **prior to the deduction of operating costs, validator incentives, rebates, or redistributions**.
    
- Any operator(s) (entities, protocols, etc) leveraging a fork, derivative, or modified version of the ZERA Network or its components must calculate, report, and remit this revenue on a quarterly basis.  
    Reports and payment confirmations must be published within 90 days of the end of each fiscal quarter, using a publicly accessible and verifiable method.
    
- **Clarification on Scope**:  
    This revenue-sharing requirement does **not** apply to applications or tools that merely interact with the ZERA Network code via APIs or interfaces, as long as they do **not** modify or redistribute any ZERA fee-generating components.

### 3. Attribution Requirements

- Any public-facing implementation, modification, fork, or derivative work of this software must include a clear and prominent attribution to the ZERA Network and the original ZERA software.
    
- Attribution must include the phrase:  
    **“This Network technology is a modification of software originally developed for the ZERA Network, licensed under the ZERA Open Use and Revenue Sharing License.”**
    
- This notice must appear in the source code and network documentation.
    
- Attribution may not be removed or obscured, and derivative projects must not misrepresent their relationship to the original ZERA project.

### 4. Breach and Legal Enforcement

- In the event of a breach of these licensing terms, any holder of **ZERA** ($ZRA+0000) has the right to initiate legal proceedings against the violating party. To reduce frivolous actions, the following conditions apply:
    
    - Prior to initiating litigation, the initiating party must make a good-faith effort to resolve the issue via mediation or arbitration.
        
    - A governance proposal authorizing legal action must be approved and recorded via the **$LEGAL+0000** contract on the ZERA Network.
        
- If legal action results in a settlement, judgment, or awarded damages, the proceeds will be distributed as follows:
    
    - **25 percent** to the individual(s) or group(s) who initiated and executed the enforcement action
        
    - **75 percent** to the **ZERA Treasury**
        
- The violating party must return to full compliance with this license, make all required payments (including retroactive), and publish proof of compliance.

### 5. No Warranty and Limitation of Liability

- This software is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.
    
- In no event shall the authors or contributors be held liable for any damages or claims arising from the use of this software.
    

---

### 6. Reciprocal Ecosystem Access

- Any tools, protocols, technologies, or software developed using this software — including through forks, integrations, or modifications — must be made available for **free use within the ZERA Network ecosystem**.
    
- This includes the right of the ZERA Network to utilize, operate, integrate, or extend such technology **without fee, license, or restriction**, provided it is used within the scope or developed using code operating under this license
    
- This clause is irrevocable and survives regardless of licensing structure applied by the downstream project, provided ZERA code or derivatives are in use.
    

---

### 7. Fair Market Behavior and Fee Parity

- Any fork, modification, or derivative work utilizing this software or its components must not offer usage fees or economic terms **lower than the equivalent fees charged by the ZERA Network**, where such a comparison exists.
    
- In cases where the ZERA Network does **not yet natively offer a comparable service**, the fork or derivative must price its services in accordance with **reasonable market standards and general economic parity**, as aligned with the intended design and value proposition of the original ZERA Network model.
    
- The ZERA governance process, via the **$LEGAL+0000** contract on the ZERA Network, reserves the right to review and contest any fee structures that are believed to violate this principle. Upon passage of a formal governance proposal, a **minimum fair-use fee** may be established for a given service or implementation.
    
- If such a minimum has been set by **$LEGAL+0000** governance contract on the ZERA Network, any fork, derivative, or implementation subject to this license must update its fee structures to be **no lower than the established minimum**, and must do so within 90 days of the governance outcome becoming binding.
    
- Failure to comply constitutes a breach of this license and will trigger enforcement under Section 4.
